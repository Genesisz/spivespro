        title: "Huge Talent Pool, Few Opportunities:",
        description: "Across Africa, millions of young footballers showcase their skills on local pitches, schools, and community leagues every day. Yet only a handful are ever seen by scouts or academies. Globally, less than 1% of academy players turn professional â€” and in Africa, the chances are even slimmer due to limited scouting networks."

        title: "Exploitation & Fake Agents:",
        description: "Many young African footballers fall victim to fake agents who exploit their dreams with false promises of trials abroad. Families often make huge sacrifices, only for players to end up stranded. This widespread fraud creates mistrust, making it harder for genuine scouts to find talent and leaving many opportunities lost."
